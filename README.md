# Tonic pain signature (ToPS)

This repository contains de-identified functional connectivity data and the analysis scripts for reproducing main figures of an under-review paper, "A neuroimaging biomarker for sustained experimental and clinical pain".

To download Tonic Pain Signature (ToPS), we ask you to send a short request mail to Prof. Choong-Wan Woo (a.k.a. Wani). We will soon prepare a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) form and share our model to researchers who submitted the MTA form with their signatures via a web-link.
