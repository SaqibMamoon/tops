# Tonic pain signature (ToPS)

This repository contains the tutorial scripts for reproducing main figures of an under-review paper, "A neuroimaging biomarker for sustained experimental and clinical pain".

De-identified functional connectivity and example fMRI data, and associated pain ratings can be downloaded via this [link](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13082519.v1).

To download Tonic Pain Signature (ToPS), we ask you to send a short request mail to Prof. Choong-Wan Woo (a.k.a. Wani). We will soon prepare a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) form and share our model to researchers who submitted the MTA form with their signatures via a web-link.

Send a request mail! [choongwan.woo@gmail.com](mailto:choongwan.woo@gmail.com)

## Prerequisite

1. Please download the compressed zip file ('data.zip') that contains all the associated data ([link](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13082519.v1)), and un-zip the file into the 'tops' folder (path: /tops/data).

2. For running 'example_participant_script.m', [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) must be installed.

3. For running 'example_participant_script.m' and 'whole_participant_script.m', you should first download the 'ToPS_weight.mat' file (please send a request mail as described above to get this file) and locate the file in the 'model' folder (path: /tops/model/ToPS_weight.mat).
